    "Now, let's expand on this with the new things we've learned. At this point, we are going to hard-code in three specific movies (Back to the Future, Blade, Spirited Away) and assume they all have the same rating, `8`. We will create some functions that will accomplish some specific goals.\n",

    "3. A `function` that, when called, will list all available movies. So, at this point, it will be listing the three movies we hard-coded above.\n",
    "4. A `function` that, when called with the name of a movie as its argument, will tell the user whether or not that movie is available (i.e. if that movie is in your list of movies).\n",
    "5. A `function` that, when called with the name of a movie as its argument, will tell the user the rating of that movie (at this point, it will always be 8, but remember that eventually the value for movie_rating will change, so make sure your code reflects that). If the movie is not available (i.e. not in your list), the function will tell the user that the rating is unavailable.\n",
    "6. A `function` that allows you to pass a list as an argument which will print out whether each movie in the list has a \"great\" rating (8 or more), a \"good\" rating (6 or more), a \"bad\" rating (less than 6), or no rating (i.e. the movie is unavailable).\n",

How can you fix that? Once you think conceptually of the solution, search Google to see if you can find out how to do it in Python.\n",

    "> Something to think about: Imagine someone actually using your final application. For instance, it would be better for your print-out to say something like \"The rating for Blade is 8\" instead of just \"8\". Make sure that the output of your functions looks nice instead of just basically meeting the requirments. Use meaningful comments and variable names."
